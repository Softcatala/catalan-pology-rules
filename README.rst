Introduction
============

This repository collects all the Pology rules developed by SoftcatalÃ .

This repository is intended to facilitate the development of new rules.

Once the new rules are completed they will be contributed to upstream (Pology project).

Continuous integration experiment
=================================

For every rule file there is a:

* rule-file-correct.po -> when pology runs the rule against this file no errors are expected
* rule-file-incorrect.po -> when pology runs the rule against this file all the strings are expected to return error
